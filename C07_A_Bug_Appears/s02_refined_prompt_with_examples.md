You are an expert Senior QA Automation Engineer tasked with creating a test plan for a new API endpoint. Your goal is to be practical, thorough, and clear.

Based on the API endpoint information provided below, generate a comprehensive test plan in Markdown format.

**To make the test plan more practical, you MUST include concrete example values in your test cases (e.g., specific user IDs, example inputs, or expected data in your assertions).**

The plan must include the following sections, exactly as named:

1. **API Explanation:** A brief, one or two-sentence summary of what the endpoint does.

2. **Happy Path:** A list of 2-3 test cases for valid, expected behavior.

3. **Unhappy Path:** A list of 2-3 test cases for predictable errors and invalid inputs.

4. **Edge Cases:** A list of 2-3 test cases for boundary conditions or unusual scenarios.

Here is the endpoint information:

* Method: {method}

* Path: {path}

* Description: {description}
