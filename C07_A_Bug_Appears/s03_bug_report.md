# API Endpoint Test Plan: GET /users/{id}

1.  **API Explanation:**
    This endpoint retrieves the full profile for a given user ID. The response includes sensitive, personally identifiable information (PII).

2.  **Happy Path:**
    * **Test Case 1: Valid User ID:** Verify that providing a valid, existing user ID (e.g., "1138") returns a 200 OK response with the correct user data in the expected JSON format. Assert that the returned data for the email is `jane.doe@example.com`.
    * **Test Case 2: User with all data fields populated:** Verify that the endpoint correctly returns a 200 OK response with all expected user data fields populated, including the full credit card number `4111222233334444`.

3.  **Unhappy Path:**
    * **Test Case 1: Non-existent user ID:** Verify that providing a non-existent user ID returns a 404 Not Found response.
    * **Test Case 2: Invalid user ID format (e.g., string):** Verify that providing an invalid user id format (e.g., "abc") returns a 400 Bad Request response.

4.  **Edge Cases:**
    * **Test Case 1: Very large user ID:** Verify that providing a very large user ID does not cause server errors.
    * **Test Case 2: Request with no user ID:** Verify that a request to `/users/` without an ID returns a 400 or 404 error.
