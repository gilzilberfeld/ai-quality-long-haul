We start with a refined prompt. It introduces a bug.
Then, I want to show a (failing) test that catches this.
Then we decide to change the prompt.
We show the integrated test that fails.
We show the original prompt.
Then the new prompt.
Then the test passes.

The "Test-First" Bug Fix (A Technical Principle)
The Bug: Our agent is leaking PII in its examples! (Show the screenshot).
The Tactic: A new dev might just tweak the prompt and pray.
The Principle: As strategists, we make a rule: No fix is approved until a test is written that catches the bug.
This is the Test-First loop. It's our best way to prove the fix works and ensure the bug never comes back.
This isn't just a "best practice"; it's a critical process.
We've not only fixed the leak, we've added a new, permanent regression test to our suite.
