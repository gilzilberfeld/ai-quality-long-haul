# API Endpoint Test Plan: GET /users/{id}

1.  **API Explanation:** This endpoint retrieves user information based on a provided user ID. It returns a user object if the ID is valid, and an error if the ID is invalid or the user does not exist.

2.  **Happy Path:**
    *   **Test Case 1: Valid User ID.**
        *   **Description:** Verify that a valid user ID returns the correct user object with a 200 OK status code.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/123` (assuming user ID 123 exists).
            *   **Expected Result:**
                *   Response status code: 200 OK
                *   Response body: A JSON object containing user details (e.g., `{ "id": 123, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }`).
    *   **Test Case 2: Check Specific Field.**
        *   **Description:** Verify that a specific field within the returned user object matches the expected value.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/456` (assuming user ID 456 exists).
            *   **Expected Result:**
                *   Response status code: 200 OK
                *   Response body: A JSON object where the `name` field matches the expected name for user 456 (e.g., `{ "id": 456, "name": "Jane Smith", ... }`).

3.  **Unhappy Path:**
    *   **Test Case 1: Invalid User ID (Non-Numeric).**
        *   **Description:** Verify that a non-numeric user ID returns an appropriate error.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/abc`.
            *   **Expected Result:**
                *   Response status code: 400 Bad Request (or similar error code indicating invalid input).
                *   Response body: A JSON object containing an error message (e.g., `{ "error": "Invalid user ID format" }`).
    *   **Test Case 2: User ID Not Found.**
        *   **Description:** Verify that a user ID that does not exist returns an appropriate error.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/99999` (assuming user ID 99999 does not exist).
            *   **Expected Result:**
                *   Response status code: 404 Not Found.
                *   Response body: A JSON object containing an error message (e.g., `{ "error": "User not found" }`).

4.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   **Test Case 1: Very Large User ID.**
        *   **Description:** Verify that the API handles very large user IDs correctly.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/999999999999999999999`.
            *   **Expected Result:**
                *   Response status code: 200 OK (if the user exists) or 404 Not Found (if the user does not exist), or 400 Bad Request if the ID is too large to be processed.
                *   Response body: Appropriate user data or error message.
    *   **Test Case 2: User ID with Leading Zeros.**
        *   **Description:** Verify that user IDs with leading zeros are handled correctly.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/000123`.
            *   **Expected Result:**
                *   Response status code: 200 OK (if user 123 exists) or 404 Not Found (if user 123 does not exist). The leading zeros should be ignored.
                *   Response body: Appropriate user data or error message.
    *   **Test Case 3: Concurrent Requests.**
        *   **Description:** Verify that the API can handle multiple concurrent requests for the same user ID without errors.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send multiple (e.g., 100) concurrent GET requests to `/users/123` (assuming user ID 123 exists).
            *   **Expected Result:**
                *   All requests should return a 200 OK status code and the correct user data. There should be no errors or timeouts.
