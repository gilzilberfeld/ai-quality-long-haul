Okay. We've plugged the leaks in our "kayak." It's stronger.
But everything we've done so far has been REACTIVE. We've been fixing bugs that already happened.
A "Strategist" doesn't just plug leaks. A Strategist prepares for the problems they can't see yet.

The rest of this webinar is about PROACTIVE quality systems. This is the core of the "Strategist" mindset. Let's build the three key systems our "Ship" needs to survive.

It's when your tests are all GREEN... but your AI is slowly getting dumber.
The model's personality changes, it gets chattier, or more formal, or refuses certain prompts. Your old tests pass, but the user experience is tanking.
In addition, think about the threshold of our quality score. When we start our tests are passing because the quality score is a lot higher than the threshold. But they can continue to pass the bear minimum even if they continue to drift towards it. We'd like to know earlier.

Your quality is drifting towards the rocks, and your alarms are silent.

Introduce the concept of storing the quality scores from every test run in a simple database (a JSON file).

Show log of results.
Show test that produces the JSON file.
Show test for immediate drop in quality.
Show test that checks average score has been slowly trending downwards.
