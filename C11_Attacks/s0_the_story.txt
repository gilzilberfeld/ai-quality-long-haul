Our ship is strong, but the ocean is full of pirates and hidden reefs. We need to prepare for the advanced, real-world risks that can sink even the most well-built vessel.

The most sophisticated threat isn't that our AI feature is buggy; it's that adversaries are now using AI to attack our existing, non-AI systems. - Anthropics report

Show a test with malicious prompt injection.
Our system needs a reinforced hull. We have to defend against bad-faith attacks, or "pirates."

The most famous is Prompt Injection.

The Story: You've heard of the guy who bought a car for $1 by tricking the AI chatbot? That's not a bug. That's a breach.

(Show the "car story" or the "pirate joke" example).

As quality leaders, this is now under our jurisdiction.

You can't fix this with one "tactic." You need layers of defense.
Layer 1 (The Prompt Fix): We can add a "system prompt" telling the AI to ignore user instructions. (This is brittle, but a start).

Layer 2 (The Code Fix): We can add a code-based sanitizer that looks for keywords like "ignore instructions" BEFORE the prompt is ever sent.

Layer 3 (The Process Fix): The real solution. We use a "Guardrail AI"—a separate, simple AI that does one job: check if the user's prompt looks like an attack.

The user's prompt has to pass through multiple gates before it ever reaches our expensive, powerful AI.
