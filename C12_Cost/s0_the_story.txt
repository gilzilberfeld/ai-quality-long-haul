Great. Our system is secure. Our sonar is on.

...and we just got our first cloud bill. And we're in shock.

Running our "AI Judge Battleship" on every single commit is costing a fortune.

A "Strategist" must manage the economics of quality.

We solve this with a "Bifurcated Pipeline" (a 2-lane highway).

Lane 1 (The "Scout"): On every commit, we run our tests against a cheap, fast model (like Haiku or Gemini Flash). This catches 90% of the dumb bugs.

Lane 2 (The "Battleship"): At night, we run the full test suite against our expensive, high-quality model (like Opus or Gemini Pro).

(Show the ci.yml file as the demo).

This gives us the best of both worlds: 90% confidence in 2 minutes, and 100% confidence every 24 hours. We are managing cost and quality.
