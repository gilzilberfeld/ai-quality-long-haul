# API Test Plan: GET /users/{id}

## 1. API Explanation:

This endpoint retrieves a user's information based on the provided unique ID. It returns user details if a user with the specified ID exists, and an error if the ID is invalid or no user is found.

## 2. Happy Path:

*   **Test Case 1: Valid User ID Returns User Data**
    *   **Description:**  Verify that a valid, existing user ID returns the correct user data in a 200 OK response.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Send a GET request to `/users/{id}` with a known valid user ID (e.g., `/users/123`).
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
            *   Response Body:  Contains the user's data (e.g., `{ "id": 123, "username": "testuser", "email": "test@example.com" }`) and the data matches the expected user.

*   **Test Case 2: Response Content Type is JSON**
    *   **Description:** Verify that the response is returned with the `application/json` content type.
    *   **Steps:**
        1. Send a GET request to `/users/{id}` with a known valid user ID (e.g., `/users/123`).
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
        *   Response Header: `Content-Type: application/json`

## 3. Unhappy Path:

*   **Test Case 1: Invalid User ID (Non-Numeric) Returns Error**
    *   **Description:** Verify that attempting to retrieve a user with a non-numeric ID returns an appropriate error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Send a GET request to `/users/{id}` with an invalid, non-numeric user ID (e.g., `/users/abc`).
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request
            *   Response Body: Contains an error message indicating the ID format is invalid.

*   **Test Case 2: Non-Existent User ID Returns 404**
    *   **Description:** Verify that attempting to retrieve a user with an ID that does not exist returns a 404 Not Found error.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Send a GET request to `/users/{id}` with a valid, but non-existent user ID (e.g., `/users/9999`).
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found
            *   Response Body:  Contains an error message indicating that the user was not found.

*   **Test Case 3: Empty User ID returns 400**
    *   **Description:** Verify that attempting to retrieve a user with an empty user id returns a 400 Bad Request.
    *   **Steps:**
        1. Send a GET request to `/users/{id}` with an empty user ID (e.g., `/users/`).
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request
        *   Response Body: Contains an error message indicating that the ID is required/missing.

## 4. Edge Cases:

*   **Test Case 1:  Very Large User ID**
    *   **Description:** Verify that a very large numeric User ID (approaching the maximum integer limit) is handled correctly and does not cause an overflow or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Send a GET request to `/users/{id}` with a very large user ID (e.g., `/users/2147483647`). If the ID does exist, confirm user data is returned correctly. If the ID doesn't exist, a 404 should be returned.
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK (if user exists) or 404 Not Found (if user doesn't exist)
            *   The system handles the large number without crashing or returning incorrect data.

*   **Test Case 2: User ID containing leading zeros**
    *   **Description:** Verify that User ID containing leading zeros are handled as expected.
    *   **Steps:**
        1. Send a GET request to `/users/{id}` with a user ID containing leading zeros (e.g., `/users/00123`). If a user exists with the id '123', then return user data.
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK if user id '123' exists and the user data returned is correct. 404 if user id '123' does not exist.

*   **Test Case 3:  Concurrent Requests**
    *   **Description:** Send multiple concurrent requests to the API to test for race conditions or performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Steps:**
        1. Use a load testing tool (e.g., JMeter, Locust) to send a high volume of requests to `/users/{id}` (with valid user IDs) concurrently.
    *   **Expected Result:**
        *   The API should handle the concurrent load without errors or crashes. The response times should remain within acceptable performance limits.
