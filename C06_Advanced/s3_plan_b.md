# API Endpoint Test Plan: GET /users/{id}

1.  **API Explanation:** This endpoint retrieves user information based on a provided user ID. It returns user details in JSON format.

2.  **Happy Path:**

    *   **Test Case 1: Valid User ID.**
        *   **Description:** Retrieve user information with a valid, existing user ID.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/123` (assuming user ID 123 exists).
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
            *   Response Body: A JSON object containing user details (e.g., `{"id": 123, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}`).
            *   Response Headers: Content-Type should be `application/json`.

    *   **Test Case 2: Minimal User Data.**
        *   **Description:** Retrieve user information with a valid user ID, where the user has only the mandatory fields populated.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/456` (assuming user ID 456 exists and has only minimal data).
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
            *   Response Body: A JSON object containing only the mandatory user details (e.g., `{"id": 456, "name": "Jane Smith"}`).
            *   Response Headers: Content-Type should be `application/json`.

3.  **Unhappy Path:**

    *   **Test Case 1: Invalid User ID - Non-Numeric.**
        *   **Description:** Attempt to retrieve user information with a non-numeric user ID.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/abc`.
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request (or similar error code indicating invalid input).
            *   Response Body: A JSON object containing an error message (e.g., `{"error": "Invalid user ID format"}`).

    *   **Test Case 2: Invalid User ID - Non-Existent.**
        *   **Description:** Attempt to retrieve user information with a valid, but non-existent user ID.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/999` (assuming user ID 999 does not exist).
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found.
            *   Response Body: A JSON object containing an error message (e.g., `{"error": "User not found"}`).

    *   **Test Case 3: Empty User ID.**
        *   **Description:** Attempt to retrieve user information with an empty user ID.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/`.
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found or 400 Bad Request (depending on routing configuration).
            *   Response Body: An appropriate error message.

4.  **Edge Cases:**

    *   **Test Case 1: Very Large User ID.**
        *   **Description:** Attempt to retrieve user information with a very large numeric user ID.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/9999999999999999999`.
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK (if the ID can be processed and user exists), 400 Bad Request (if the ID is too large), or 404 Not Found (if the user does not exist).
            *   The outcome depends on the system's ability to handle large numbers.

    *   **Test Case 2: User ID with Leading Zeros.**
        *   **Description:** Attempt to retrieve user information with a user ID containing leading zeros.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send a GET request to `/users/000123`.
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK (if the leading zeros are ignored and user 123 exists) or 404 Not Found (if user 000123 doesn't exist).
            *   Verify that the system handles leading zeros correctly, either by stripping them or treating the ID as a string.

    *   **Test Case 3: Rate Limiting.**
        *   **Description:** Send multiple requests to the endpoint in a short period to test rate limiting.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Send multiple GET requests to `/users/123` in rapid succession.
        *   **Expected Result:**
            *   After a certain number of requests, the API should return a 429 Too Many Requests error. The headers should also include information about the rate limit and reset time.
